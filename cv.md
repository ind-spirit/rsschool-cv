### About me
I'm curious and do like learning a lot. For the last few years I was into web-development and front-end in particular, and recently I decided to take it on another level. Now my goal is to learn it so well, so I could make into a job. 
### Skills
I have an unfinished degree in IT, where I've learnt C++, do know front-end basics - HTML, CSS, JS. Advanced skills in PS, Lightroom and Adobe Premier. While programming, I also use Git system and follow KISS rules.

function helloWorld() { 
 alert('Hello World :)');
}
helloWorld();
```
